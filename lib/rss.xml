<br>Multivariable functions take  independent variables to return the value of one dependent variable.
<br>While a function  may be a line or, more generally, a curve in 2-D, a function  will extend to 3-D as a surface.
<br>The derivative of this function at some point wouldn't simply be the gradient of the tangent line to the surface, as it'd be too ambiguous due to the number of tangent lines that can be drawn on the surface, all with varying directions.
<br>To find the gradient of the tangent line to a surface at a point, we have to give it a direction.
<br>This direction can, in the most simple cases, be along  or  in 3-D, or it can extend along any unit vector in the plane of the independent variables as a general directional derivative.
<br><br>
<br>When calculating the gradient along the  direction (along ), the tangent line is constrained to a plane parallel to the  plane.
<br>Since this only contains the  axis,  must be treated as constant.
<br>Similarly, when calculating the gradient along the  direction,  is treated as constant.
<br>This idea of treating a variable as a constant ensures the tangent line is in the direction of the other variable and is called a partial derivative.
<br>Notation for a partial derivative with respect to :<br>

<br><br>
<br>Extending the idea of calculating the derivative along a single independent variable, directional derivatives can be calculated along any direction , where  is a unit vector.
<br>For a function  and vector , the directional derivative is denoted as  and is calculated as:  
<br><br>
<br>This expression can be rewritten as a dot product:

<br>Volume is surface area times height.
<br>Unlike calculating the area under the curve, we have to push our perspective up by one dimension. That is to say, we have to calculate the volume under a surface.
<br>For some surface , this idea will first need us to set an interval for both  and .
<br>These two intervals will give us a rectangle on the  plane shadowing the section of the surface we want to calculate the volume under.
<br>So, if we have  and , we get a rectangle on the  plane with the area .
<br>If we cut the rectangle up into  sections along the  axis and  sections along the  axis to give smaller rectangles with uniform width and height, we get these small lengths and breadths  and  as:
<br><br>
<br>The area of each rectangle is .
<br>Thus, the volume of each tiny section is this surface area times the  value at those particular points. That is to say,
<br><br>
<br>The more smaller we make the number of tiny sections, the more we can approximate the area under the section.
<br>If we have, say, an infinite number of sections (i.e. ), we'd have the exact value of the volume:
<br><br><br>
<br>The region we calculate volume along can either be rectangular or non-rectangular.
<br>In a rectangular case, we'd have:
<br><br>
<br>
Setting up this integral is simple:


<br>
Or, changing the order of  and ,

<br><br>
<br>Take a region bounded by  and . If we want to find the volume of a surface confined to the area of intersection of these regions:
<br>First, we have to plot out these two functions:
<br><img alt="plot of two functions" src="assets/images/plot1.png"><br>
<br>We get two points of intersections:  and .
<br>To evaluate the volume within this area from a surface, we have to set up the double integral as:
<br><br>
<br>Or in terms of ,
<br><br>
<br>The order of limits here matter as when we observe from the  axis, we'll have to take the left-most equation as the lower limit and right-most as the upper limit. And for the  axis, we have to take the bottom-most equation (within the intersecting region) as the lower limit and the upper-most as the upper limit.
